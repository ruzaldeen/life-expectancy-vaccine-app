# **TOPIC: FORECASTING LIFE EXPECTANCY BASED ON IMMUNIZATION TRENDS**

## **1. PROJECT BACKGROUND**
- Life expectancy is a key indicator of national health and reflects how effectively countries prevent disease and support long-term wellbeing.
- Immunization plays a major role in improving population health, with higher vaccine coverage consistently associated with lower mortality and longer lifespan.
- This project aims to provide insights that support public health planning and align with Sustainable Development Goal 3 - Good Health and Well-being by analyzing global vaccination and life expectancy data.

A Streamlit-based data product that predicts life expectancy based on vaccine coverage rates and provides comprehensive data visualizations.

### **ii. Features**
#### - **Multiple User Flows.**
  The application offers three distinct flows to accommodate different user needs:
#####  **i. Page: Visualization Only**
    - Upload your data and explore various visualizations without needing a trained model
    - Consists of 5 tab : Summary, Global Overview, Vaccine Analysis, Correlations and COuntry Analysis.
    i. **Global Overview**: Life expectancy distribution and trends over time
    ii. **Vaccine Coverage Analysis**: Average coverage by vaccine type and trends
    iii. **Correlation Analysis**: Vaccine vs life expectancy correlations and heatmaps
    iv. **Country Analysis**: Country-specific trends and top/bottom rankings

#####  **ii. Page: Prediction Only**
    - Load your pre-trained model and make predictions on vaccine coverage scenarios
    - Single Prediction tab: Have input features for year and country and show predict life expectancy based on filter.
    - Comparison tab: Same input features but have comparison two different filter.

### **iii. Installation**

1. Clone or download this project

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## **5. File Information Details**

### **i. File Structure**
```
vaccine_life_expectancy_app/
├── app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── README.md             # This file

    ├── model.joblib
    ├── scaler.joblib
    ├── imputer.joblib
    └── feature_names.joblib
```

### **ii. Model Requirements**

#### 1. Saving Your Model from Google Colab

When training your model in Google Colab, save the following artifacts using joblib:

```python
import joblib

# After training your model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.joblib')  # Optional: if you used StandardScaler
joblib.dump(imputer, 'imputer.joblib')  # Optional: if you used SimpleImputer
joblib.dump(feature_names, 'feature_names.joblib')  # List of feature column names
```

#### 2. Expected Feature Names
The app expects these vaccine columns (or a subset based on your model):
- BCG, DTP1, DTP3, HEPB3, HEPBB, HIB3
- IPV1, IPV2, MCV1, MCV2, MENGA, PCV3
- POL3, RCV1, ROTAC, YFV

#### 3. Data Format

##### Input Dataset
Your CSV/TXT/Excel file should contain:
- `country` - Country name
- `country_code` - ISO country code (optional)
- `year` - Year of observation
- Vaccine columns (BCG, DTP1, DTP3, etc.) - Coverage percentages (0-100)
- `life_expectancy` - Life expectancy in years

Example:
```csv
country,year,BCG,DTP1,DTP3,MCV1,life_expectancy
Afghanistan,2020,72.0,70.0,61.0,57.0,61.454
Algeria,2020,99.0,94.0,84.0,80.0,73.257
```

## **6. How to Use**

##### For Visualization Only:
1. Select "📊 Visualization Only" in the sidebar
2. Upload your dataset (CSV/TXT/Excel)
3. Navigate through the tabs to explore different visualizations

##### For Prediction Only:
1. Select "🔮 Prediction Only" in the sidebar
2. Upload your trained model (.joblib or .pkl)
3. Optionally upload scaler, imputer, and feature names
4. Click "Load Model"
5. Enter vaccine coverage values and click "Predict"

##### For Both:
1. Select "📊🔮 Both" in the sidebar
2. Upload your dataset for visualizations
3. Upload your trained model for predictions
4. Navigate between tabs for different features

##### 🛠️ Customization
1. Adding New Vaccines
Edit the `VACCINE_INFO` dictionary in `app.py` to add new vaccine types:

```python
VACCINE_INFO = {
    'NEW_VACCINE': 'Description of the new vaccine',
    # ... existing vaccines
}
```

##### Changing Theme
The app uses custom CSS for styling. Modify the `st.markdown()` section with the `<style>` tags to customize colors and appearance.

###### Notes

- The app uses Plotly for interactive visualizations
- All charts have dark theme styling
- Session state is used to persist data and model between interactions
- Temporary files are cleaned up after model loading

##### Troubleshooting

**Model not loading?**
- Ensure your model was saved with `joblib.dump()`
- Check that scikit-learn versions match between training and deployment

**Visualizations not showing?**
- Verify your dataset has the expected column names
- Check that numeric columns contain valid numbers

**Prediction errors?**
- Ensure feature names match between model training and input
- Upload the feature_names.joblib file if available
