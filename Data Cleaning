Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Python (pandas, numpy) to integrate immunization, life expectancy, and developing country datasets in a reproducible workflow.
The developing country list was extracted from an online source, loaded into a DataFrame, deduplicated, standardized, and used as a reference filter. Immunization data were sourced from a multi-sheet UNICEF Excel file, where all country-level sheets were combined into a single DataFrame and regional summaries processed separately. The data were reshaped from wide to long format by consolidating yearly columns into year and coverage. Missing value analysis was conducted, and variables with more than 50% missing values were removed. Numerical fields were converted to integer types.
Life expectancy data were extracted from a World Bank CSV file, with empty columns removed, headers standardized, and year variables converted to numeric formats. The dataset was reshaped to support time-series analysis.
All cleaned datasets were merged by country and year, restricted to developing countries, and exported as CSV files. Basic
